This `README.md` file serves as an example how a this will look like in a standard Plutus project. Below listed out the sample section.

## Abstract

This project implements a hybrid trading strategy on the VN30F1M futures index using the Simple Moving Average (SMA-100) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI-14). The strategy aims to capture mean-reversion signals that occur when RSI reaches extreme levels (overbought/oversold) against the prevailing SMA trend. We backtest the strategy using data from Algotrade, evaluating performance through returns, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown. Results suggest the approach can yield consistent returns under specific market conditions.

## Introduction

Algorithmic trading has become an essential component of modern financial markets, allowing traders to implement and automate strategies based on well-defined rules and quantitative signals. Among the various classes of strategies, mean-reversion and momentum-based approaches are two fundamental techniques widely used by both retail and institutional traders.

This project focuses on applying a hybrid mean-reversion and momentum strategy to the VN30F1M futures index, one of the most liquid and volatile derivatives instruments in the Vietnamese market. The strategy is built on two core technical indicators:

- Simple Moving Average (SMA) with a 100-period window is used to capture the long-term trend direction.
- The Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a 14-period window is employed to identify short-term overbought and oversold conditions.

## Trading (Algorithm) Hypotheses

When the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates oversold or overbought conditions and aligns with the broader trend confirmed by a slower-moving average, prices are likely to revert to their mean. This creates opportunities to trade counter to short-term extremes while respecting the dominant trend.

## Optimization

- üîç Optimization Step
The project uses Optuna ‚Äî an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework ‚Äî to find the best combination of trading strategy parameters that maximize returns.

- üí° Optimization Method
The optimization uses Optuna's TPE Sampler (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator).

The goal is to maximize the final asset value at the end of the trading period.

The process automatically explores parameter combinations and records their performance, helping find the most profitable strategy.

| Parameter    | Description                      | Search space               |

| sma_window   | calculate a Simple Moving Average| Integer from `50` to `200` |
| rsi_lower    | The buy threshold                | Float from `20.0` to `35.0`|

## Conclusion:

- The backtesting results reveal a significant discrepancy between the in-sample and out-sample performance of the strategy, despite using the same optimized parameters. While the in-sample phase showed strong profit growth, the out-sample test suffered from both negative returns and high drawdowns, suggesting potential overfitting to historical data rather than genuine robustness.

- Additionally, during further testing with conventional parameters (SMA window = 100, RSI 30/70), the asset curve flattened for a large part of the period. This indicates that the strategy‚Äôs signal conditions were either too restrictive or the market conditions did not trigger any trades for extended periods. Such behavior highlights that the strategy's logic may have low adaptability and high sensitivity to parameter settings, especially in varying market environments.

- In summary, the current algorithm exhibits signs of overfitting and structural fragility. Further review is recommended to:

- Reconsider entry/exit rules to avoid dead zones.

- Allow more dynamic thresholds.

- Add market regime detection or parameter stability testing before deployment.
